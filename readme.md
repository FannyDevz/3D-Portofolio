Please install [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)‚ö†Ô∏è  

## Development
```sh
bash dev.sh
```
- Run webpack build watch and nodemon websocket
- Only build files **not serve files**, you still need to serve `public/index.html` file with public folder as relative path. Please use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)  


## Production

```sh
bash prod.sh
```
- Run Coturn Server and websocket server and build files  
- Only build files **not serve files**, you still need to serve `public/index.html` file with public folder as relative path. Please use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

1. Please write `<!-- COPY --> content <!-- ENDCOPY -->` in readme file that you want to copy to [readme.md's JohansenJunias20.github.io](https://github.com/JohansenJunias20/JohansenJunias20.github.io/blob/master/readme.md)  
  
## Files
### .env 
- Config will be sent to `/src/*.tsx` through webpack config files
- `build.sh` is responsible for passing variables in .env to webpack config file
- Flow: `/.env` &#8594; `build.sh` &#8594; `webpack.(dev/prod).js` &#8594; `/src/*.tsx`

### build.sh
- Build `/src/*.tsx` files to `/public/dist/bundle.js`
- If you are not sure what arguments suit for you just run `dev.sh` or `prod.sh`
- Contain **2 arguments**
    - `-m | --mode DEV/PROD` specify the mode
      - mode **DEV** will pass dev config from .env file and use `webpack.dev.js` as file config to compile `/src/*.tsx` files
      - mode **PROD** will pass prod config from .env file and use `webpack.prod.js` as file config to compile `/src/*.tsx` files
    - `-d | --use-docker` with virtualization or not, if you dont have docker installed you can leave this option unwritten (assuming you have node js and npm installed).
      - On **windows**, **do not** use DEV mode with virtualization because **windows** are not signalling file changes to docker mounted volumes
